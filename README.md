# About me

Hello ðŸ‘‹, Welcome!

## Story

My name is Dale and I currently live in Brooklyn, New York, ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.
I live in a tiny apartment amongst the chaotic and messy streets of the city, it's not for everyone but, I love it.

I started my journey in Melbourne, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º. In 2015, I was lucky enough to join a fast-growing start-up [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com)
as the first employee. A Cloud Guru went from one person to over 600 in 4 years. I (and eventually my team) worked on what
I think to be some of the most interesting/critical parts of the platform, such as; video delivery & transcoding, course management,
billing & subscription, content search, video transcoding, etc. 

After around 4 years of working within / leading a product team, I wanted to try something different; this is when I moved to Austin, Texas
 and started leading the DevOps team. The purpose of this team was to provide the 19 product teams with best practices; these were made available through
 a Serverless [Golden Path](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/).

In 2021 A Cloud Guru got acquired by [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) in the 2nd largest tech acquisition in Australian history. What a crazy time.
  
Now in 2022 / 2023, I am working for another Serverless start-up, [Vendia](https://www.vendia.com/).
Vendia is an inter-company data sharing platform, that uses a [permissioned blockchain](https://101blockchains.com/permissioned-blockchain/).
Vendia is founded by the creator of AWS Lambda, Tim Wagner. 

## Technology Interests

I have interests in Serverless, AWS CDK, Leadership, Observability and DevOps. Which is what I am here for, to capture my thoughts
and to share some of my successes and failures in trying to bring these concepts together
